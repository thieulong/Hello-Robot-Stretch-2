  # Goal Tolerance Parameters
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.09          # (5 degrees) The tolerance in radians for the controller in yaw/rotation when achieving its goal

  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: false    # If goal tolerance is latched, if the robot ever reaches the goal xy location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the goal tolerance while it is doing so.
